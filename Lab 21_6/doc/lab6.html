            CSE21 : Lab#6 - Object Oriented Programming
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        	This week we are going to be introduced to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. 
        	We are going to use a new problem of implementing the Cheese shop. 
        	Luckily, we have provided substantial amount of the code for gentle introduction into this new territory. 
        	This lab can serve as a study guide for OOP and recursion. We solve the cheese problem using recursion in the main code. 
        	We also implement additional logic that gives has 1% chance of giving free cheese when checking out.
